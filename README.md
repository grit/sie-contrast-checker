### What is APCA?
APCA(Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm) is a modern color contrast algorithm that aims to be be perceptually uniform. It is currently being evaluated as a part of the WCAG 3 draught process.

Note: Because APCA is still being evaluated, it is likely that some aspects of the algorithm and scoring system will change between APCA versions.

### How stuff works
This plugin uses a few key dependencies:
- [react](https://reactjs.org) for rendering the UI.
- [apca-w3](https://github.com/Myndex/apca-w3) for APCA contrast calculations.
- [chroma-js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js) to help with some color conversions.
- [stitches](https://stitches.dev) for css in JS.
- [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) for UI components.
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management.

There are two dependencies entirely for building and bundling:
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev) - A dev server that takes all the frontend code in `./ui-src` and spits it out into `./dist/index.html` via a script tag.
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) - a bundler that takes all the Figma side code in `./plugin-src` and spits it our into `./dist/code.js`
